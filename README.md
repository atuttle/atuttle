## Hey, I'm Adam. 

I built a career on writing CFML, but I've since transitioned to TypeScript, React, and hopefully, Svelte. 

I'm the CTO of [AlumnIQ](https://www.alumniq.com/).

I have [a blog where I write about mostly tech stuff](https://adamtuttle.codes). Lately I've been on a mission to get _better_ at testing.

I am the founder and co-host of the [Working Code Podcast](https://workingcode.dev), and I wrote a book called [REST Assured: A Pramatic Approach to API Design](https://restassuredbook.com).

In my free time I like to [skydive](https://www.tiktok.com/@planespooppeople) (600+ jumps to date), make wooden bowls and furniture, go hiking and camping with my family, and sometimes I still find time to work on open source software.
