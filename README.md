## Hey, I'm Adam. 

I built a career on writing CFML, but I'm in the middle of a transition to JavaScript. 

I'm the CTO of [AlumnIQ](https://www.alumniq.com/).

I have [a blog where I write about mostly tech stuff](https://adamtuttle.codes). Lately I've been on a mission to get _way better_ at testing.

I am the founder and co-host of the [Working Code Podcast](https://workingcode.dev), and I wrote a book called [REST Assured: A Pramatic Approach to API Design](https://restassuredbook.com).

In my free time I like to [skydive](https://www.instagram.com/adamtuttle/) (I made my 500th jump in May 2021!), make wooden furniture, go hiking and camping with my family, and sometimes I still find time to work on open source software.
